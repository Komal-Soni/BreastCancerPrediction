# BreastCancerPrediction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for breast cancer classification using a comprehensive dataset of clinical and pathological features. The primary objective is to accurately predict whether a breast cancer case is malignant or benign, enabling early detection and effective treatment planning. Through rigorous data exploration, preprocessing, and model development, the project identifies the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model as the top performer, exhibiting exceptional accuracy, precision, sensitivity/recall, specificity, and F1-score. The project's insights and findings hold significant potential to improve patient outcomes, enhance healthcare decision-making, and contribute to the advancement of breast cancer management practices.
